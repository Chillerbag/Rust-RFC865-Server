# RFC 865 - QOTD

## Overview
This project is an implementation of RFC 865 - QOTD. It implements a QOTD server using TCP that can be easily hosted.
It accepts requests on port 17, as per specfication.
I have also included some niceties, such as IP Throttling, because I designed this to run on my home internet. Change if desired in .env!

## Development
This is a work in progress. I want to finish it by the 28th though.
